# Recurrent Neutral Network

## List
1. RNN
2. Backforward

## Rucurent Neutral Network
1. Vanilla Neutral Network:One to One
2. Process Sequences
   1. One to many
   2. many to One
   3. many to many

Idea:A hidden state in the computional graph.The input upgrades the hidden state as while as produces a output.

$$State_t = f_W(State_{t-1},input)$$

For example:
$$h_t = tanh((W_{hh} \ W_{xh})(\begin{array}{c}
   h_{t-1} \\ x_t
\end{array} ))$$$$Output = W_{hy}h_t$$
where $W_{hh}$ $W_{xh}$ $W_{hy}$is the parameters.

The hidden layer is the ''memory'' of the model

## Backforward

- Traditional method:Wasting time and occupying more memory.
- Truncated Backpropagation through time
    
    Run forward and backward through chunks of the sequence instead of whole sequences.
