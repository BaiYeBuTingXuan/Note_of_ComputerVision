## Loss Function

    Loss Funtion is designed to measure the unaccuracy of the Classifier.

    "To quantify how bad are different mistakes"

## Loss Calculating Algorithm

General Format:$$Loss = \Sigma Loss_{i}(f(input;Weight);fact)$$

- SVM: 
$$Loss = \Sigma_{i \neq j} \max\{0, s_i - s_j + 1\}$$       

  note: $ i \neq j$ is necessary, or the Loss for a perfect answer is result in 1 not 0.

- Regularization Term: to pick a simpler $\mathbb{W}$
    $$Loss = \Sigma Loss_{i}(f(input;Weight);fact)+ \lambda \mathbb{R(Weight)}$$

    $\lambda$ is a hyporparameter to balence the two terms.

        Occam's Razor:"Among competing hypotheses, the simplest is the best."
