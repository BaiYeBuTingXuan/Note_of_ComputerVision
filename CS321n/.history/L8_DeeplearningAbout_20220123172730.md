# DeepLearning About

## LIST

1. CPUs and GPUs
2. Hyperparameters
3. Image


## CPUs and GPUs

- CPU ï¼š Central Processing Unit
  - Fewer cores but each cores is much faster and much more capable
  - Great at squential  tasks
- GPU :  Graphics Processing Unit
  - More cores,but each core is much slower and "dumber"
  - Great for parallel tasks,like mutipulation of matrix

In deeplearning,we usaully use NVIDIA rather than AMD.

### Programming on GPUs
- CUDA(NVIDIA only)
  - Write C-like code that run directly on GPU
  - Higher level APIs:cuBLAS,cuFFT,cuDNN,etc
- OpenCL
  - Similer to CUDA,but runs on anything
  - Usually slower

## Hyperparameters

- Best value of K to use

- Best distance Metric to use

'Hyperparameters':Choices about the algorithm that we set rather than learn which is very problem-dependent.

## Setting Hyperparameters

Divide the data to 3 part:
- train data
- validation
- test data

No validation?The Hyperparameters we chose might only do well in solving the uniqun test data.

Attach the test data when the experiment end and take guarantee to getting away from it.

## Cross Validation Method:
Split data into folds,try each fold as validation and average the results.

Useful for small datasets,but not used too frequently in deep learning.

# Disadvantage:Image

- Very slow at test time
- Distance metrics on pixels are not 'informative'
- Curse of dimensionality
