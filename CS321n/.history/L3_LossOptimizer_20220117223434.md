## Loss Function

    Loss Funtion is designed to measure the unaccuracy of the Classifier.

    "To quantify how bad are different mistakes"

## Loss Calculating Algorithm

- SVM: 
  $$Loss = \Sigma_{i \neq j} \max\{0, s_i - s_j + 1\}$$

  note: $ i \neq j is necessary, or the Loss for a perfect answer is result in 1 not 0$
