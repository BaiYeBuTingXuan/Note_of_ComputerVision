# Primitives and Transformations
- 2D Point in inhomogeneous coordinates as:
$$ x = (x,y)^T \in \mathbb{R}^2 $$
- Or in homogeneous coordinates as:
$$ x = (\tilde{x},\tilde{y}, \tilde{\omega})^T \in \mathbb{P}^2 $$
where $\mathbb{P}^2 = \mathbb{R}^3 \ {(0,0,0)}$ is called __projective space__
    - Homogenenous vectors that differ only by scale are considered equivalent while define an equivalence class
    - Homogenenous vectors are defined only up to scale

- An inhomogeneous vector x --> a homogenenous vector $\tilde(x)$
$$ \tilde{x} = (\tilde{x},\tilde{y}, \tilde{\omega})^T = (x,y,1)^T $$
- As ''homogenenous vectors that differ only by scale are considered equivalent'':
